# How to Create the Pull Request

## Step 1: Handle Uncommitted Changes

You currently have uncommitted changes. You have two options:

### Option A: Commit the changes (Recommended if they're part of this PR)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add additional improvements and documentation"
```

### Option B: Stash the changes (if they're not ready)
```bash
git stash push -m "WIP: Uncommitted changes"
```

## Step 2: Push Your Branch

Make sure your `features` branch is pushed to remote:

```bash
# Push the branch (first time)
git push -u origin features

# Or if already pushed, just update
git push origin features
```

## Step 3: Create the Pull Request

### Option A: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "Feature: JSON-Based CMS Migration & Codebase Improvements" \
  --body-file .pr-description.md \
  --base main \
  --head features \
  --label "enhancement" \
  --label "documentation"
```

### Option B: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to: https://github.com/salamituns/Church
2. You should see a banner suggesting to create a PR from `features` branch
3. Click "Compare & pull request"
4. Copy the contents of `.pr-description.md` into the PR description
5. Add labels: `enhancement`, `documentation`
6. Set base branch to `main` (or `master` if that's your default)
7. Click "Create pull request"

### Option C: Using Git Command Line

```bash
# This will open your default browser with the PR creation page
gh pr create --web
```

## Step 4: Review and Adjust

After creating the PR:
- Review the description
- Add any additional reviewers if needed
- Add more labels if applicable
- Link any related issues

## PR Description

The PR description has been saved to `.pr-description.md`. You can:
- Review it before creating the PR
- Edit it if needed
- Copy it into the GitHub web interface
